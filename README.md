This repo will **very soon** contain all the code -- I am working on this actively -- used in the paper "Comparing and combining some popular NER approaches on Biomedical
task".  

The code for all models is in `./models`.  
General utility code is in `./utils`.   
`train.py` is the script for training the models.

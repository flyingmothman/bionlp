This repo **will very soon** contain all the code used in the paper "Comparing and combining some popular NER approaches on Biomedical
task".  
Works with `Python version 3.10` and above.  
The code for all models is in `./models`.  
General utility code is in `./utils`.  
`train.py` is the script for training the models.

**Feel Free to create an issue and chat with me there.**
This repo **will very soon** contain all the code(preprocessing, postprocessing, modeling, training) used in the paper "Comparing and combining some popular NER approaches on Biomedical tasks".  
Works with `Python version 3.10` and above ; We use an Anaconda python 3.10 environment and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
The code for all models is in `./models`.  
Utility code is in `./utils`.  
Configurations for all experiments, models, and datasets is in `./configs`.  
Preprocessed data files will be downloaded in `./preprocessed_data`.  
`train.py` is the main script for training the models.
